Learn Python without all the jargon...

Python is supposed to be an easy language to learn. Many resources
that are available contain a lot of extra information that hinder
retention of topics learned. Each file in this repository adheres 
to a naming convention where each file name begins with a number,
for example... 1_file_name.py, 2_file_name.py, and so on. Begin with
the file '1_variables_and_comments.py' then, work through the rest 
of the files consecutively and you will be a Python Developer in
no time at all.
