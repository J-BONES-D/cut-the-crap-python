Operators are symbols used to perform operations on operands(values and variables).

# Arithmetic Operators: #######################################
''' used for mathematical calculations. '''
#       +       (addition)
#       -       (subtraction)
#       *       (multiplication)
#       /       (division)
#       %       (modulus - returns the remainder of division)
#       //      (floor division - integer quotient)
#       **      (exponentiation)


# Assignment Operators: ######################################
''' used to assign values to variables. '''
#       =       (assign)
#       +=      (add and assign)
#       -=      (subtract and assign)
#       *=      (multiply and assign)
#       /=      (divide and assign)
#       %=      (modulus and assign)
#       //=     (floor divide and assign)
#       **=     (exponentiate and assign)


# Comparison Operators: ######################################
''' used to compare values. '''
#       ==      (equal to)
#       !=      (not equal to)
#       >       (greater than)
#       <       (less than)
#       >=      (greater than or equal to)
#       <=      (less than or equal to)


# Logical Operators: ###########################################################
''' used to combine conditional statements. '''
#       and     (returns True if both statements are true)
#       or      (returns True if at least one statement is true)
#       not     (reverses the result, returns False if the result is true)


# Identity Operators: ##########################################################
''' used to compare the memory locations of two objects. '''
#       is          (returns True if both variables are the same object)
#       is not      (returns True if both variables are not the same object)


# Membership Operators: #######################################################
''' used to test if a sequence is present in an object. '''
#       in          (returns True if a sequence is present in the object)
#       not in      (returns True if a sequence is not present in the object)


# Bitwise Operators: #####################################
''' used to perform bit-level operations on integers. '''
#       &       (AND)
#       |       (OR)
#       ^       (XOR)
#       ~       (NOT)
#       <<      (left shift)
#       >>      (right shift)


# Operator Precedence... the order operations are performed:
''' highest precedence to lowest precedence'''

#    Parentheses (): Solve any operations within parentheses or brackets first. 

#    Exponents: Next, address any exponents or orders (powers and roots).

#    Multiplication/Division: Then, perform multiplication and division from left to right.

#    Addition/Subtraction: Finally, carry out addition and subtraction from left to right.
