There are few ways of looping through list:

        > Iterate directly over the elements of the list with a 'for' loop.

        > Iterate through the indices of a list with a 'for' loop.

        > Use enumerate() function.
        >>>>> This functions gives the index and value of each item in the list.

        > Use a 'while' loop.
        >>>>> A developer must use index management, or a counter, to terminate the loop.
